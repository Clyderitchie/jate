# jate

## Description 
Just Another Text Editor or JATE for short, is an application that does just that, edit text. JATE allows a user to be able to take notes, write down thoughts, or even write down a shopping list on their own device. With making JATE a Progressive Web App (PWA) it allows the end user to have the quickest and best response possible. With using the webpack.config.js we are able to have the web browser render the front end smoother and much faster then if we did not use the webpack. JATE is also set up to allow a user to download/install the application to their own device so they can take their notes with them when they are offline.
